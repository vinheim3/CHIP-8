WIP readme

# Main folder:
Assembler for my assembly interpretation of CHIP-8 opcodes  
Compiler for a WIP higher-level language to assembly  
CHIP-8 virtual machine which interprets CHIP-8 binary instructions  
Text file containing organized list of opcodes  
Script to convert sprites in a text file to its CHIP-8 hex counterparts

# Snake folder:
Notes for CHIP-8 implementation  
Sprites used for Snake  
The converted binary code to download
